    \tYour partner, like you, always clearly knows what he wants, and he is used to fulfilling his desires.
    If your desires do not conflict, and even better if your desires are the same,
    then this quality greatly helps you in joint activities.
    If your desires do not fundamentally coincide or contradict each other, then this may lead to a break in the relationship.
    <br><br>

    \t<b>Recommendations for interaction:</b><br>
    \tIf you have already started to communicate with each other,
    this means that your desires no longer conflict.
    If the contradiction has arisen, try each to fulfill their desire independently, not counting on mutual support.

    \tYou are very similar with your partner to the fact that both \"think with your heart\" and it is for this reason that it is very easy for you to understand each other.
    However, the mutual understanding will last exactly as long as the emotions caused by one or another fact, you will be similar.
    In reality, you will find frequent inconsistencies between emotional highs and lows, up to the opposite:
    you rejoice at any event, and it causes anger and irritation at your partner.
    At the same time, each of you will consider your emotional vision to be the only true one.
    As a result, insults and quarrels are possible in the relationship, at best - emotional fatigue from each other and alienation.
    <br><br>

    \t<b>Recommendations for interaction:</b><br>
    \tWith a favorable arrangement of other functions and a mutual desire to maintain good relations, it will be easier for you to find mutual understanding.
    Try to remember that your partner may not share your emotional reaction.
    If you want to convince him, to direct his emotions in a different direction - use for this other functions.

    \tYou are very similar with your partner in the categorical nature of your statements and conclusions.
    As a rule, this categoricalness, if it comes into conflict with your opinion, can alienate you from your partner at the very initial stage of the relationship.
    However, if this does not happen, then your points of view on many issues coincide.
    In the future, your partner’s stubbornness and unwillingness to listen to your opinion can irritate you.
    You will not have long disputes, just if it suddenly turns out that your positions on any issues are seriously diverging, this will be a big problem for your relationship.
    <br><br>

    \t<b>Recommendations for interaction:</b><br>
    \tFind out your position on important issues for you.
    If there is a mismatch in them, try to decide how important it is for you.
    It is possible that in order to maintain good relations you will have to ban yourself forever from touching upon this \"controversial\" question in the discussions.

    \tComfort in your relationship is maintained exactly as long as your physical habits and needs coincide.
    However, if a contradiction arises in something, and physically the needs of your partner will begin to infringe upon your own,
    this can be a serious cause for conflict, even to the end of a relationship.
    <br><br>

    \t<b>Recommendations for interaction:</b><br>
    \tFirst, if you have already managed to get close, then it says that the contradictions that may arise in your relationship,
    not so serious and your union is able to hold on for a very long time, without giving you any particular inconvenience.
    If, however, domestic disagreements arise (for example, you are a lark, and your partner is an owl, you do not like to wash the dishes, and he also does not like)
    do not try to negotiate with a partner so that he will give you something and give up his habits, he is unlikely to succeed.
    Many questions are solved purely physically - separate rooms, an increase in living space, hiring a housekeeper, etc.

    \tIt is quite easy for you to come to an understanding in everyday and material matters.

    \tYour partner is like you, just as you are sure that you cannot be sure about anything.

    \tYour partner, just as you are not sure of yourself in all matters related to the material world.

    \tThe main difficulty in your relationship is mutual unwillingness to take responsibility for decision making and mutual
    resentment that this does not take into account your opinion.
    This is a very difficult relationship, each of you is waiting for a partner to reciprocate, and in the soul is ready for them, but it is necessary for someone of you to take the first step.
    As a result, each attempt to take some kind of decision can be endlessly delayed, and in each of you the resentment towards your partner will increase
    that he does not want to change anything in a similar situation.

    \t<b>Recommendations for interaction:</b><br>
    \tAlways talk out loud about your grievances, try to negotiate that you will give each other in turns,
    discuss your desires out loud and try to find a way to realize them, do not blame your partner for selfishness, remember
    that he is very similar to you in that, just like you are not able to clearly express what he wants.
